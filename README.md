Aim : The University Paris-Est wishes to provide a service for sharing electric vehicles to its teachers and students whose management is carried out with a Java application, based on Java RMI. Cars can be added to the base or be praised by all. It is possible to add notes and comments on the vehicle and its condition upon its return.

When a person requests to rent a vehicle, and it is already lent to others, it is registered on the waiting list; when the vehicle is requested available, the person is notified and leases the vehicle. If several people waiting, the Teachers are served first. If there are two students and two teachers compete on vehicle, the "first come, first served" is applied.

Secondly, Paris-Est University wants to value its base vehicles, enriched by notes and comments from teachers and students, and make it accessible to the outside via a service Web called MLVCarsService. It sells vehicles that have been introduced in its database for at least two years and have been rented at least once. The Web service provides access vehicle prices, check availability, adding them to a cart and buy them. Cart a client may at any time be changed or emptied.

To make a purchase on the Web service, another Bank Web service is contacted by MLVCarsService to check availability of funds for the purchase and payment. The Vehicle prices are in Euros, but the university allows sales in all currencies of the world, and must provide the price in the currency requested by the buyer. The exchange rates used are found in real-time.

Work to do:

Implement the classes and web services you deem necessary.
Implement a graphical interface for students and teachers for their add, search, borrow and modify the vehicles.
Implement a graphical interface for the client to MLVCarsService, enabling it to be a basket, modify, empty or validate it.
Implement a basic scenario, with a number of vehicles, clients and computers internal to the university to be able to launch the application and monitor their implementation without any intervention external.
Deliverables: 1. The project's source code (in an archive, named after the names of the students) 2. A report explaining the design choices, challenges and a manual use of the application.

PS :- Particular attention will be paid to the quality of the report. Any enrichment of the project not requested in this statement will be rewarded with additional points.
